### 📊 Discovery Audit - $500 → $300 (Portfolio Rate)

**Deliverables:**
- Current GA4/GTM audit with screenshots
- Data loss assessment 
- Prioritized recommendations report

**Note:** This is my first 3 audits - I'm offering below-market rate to gain experience presenting findings to non-technical clients. Technical audit capability is high (pharma data validation background); business communication skills being developed.

### 📈 Standard eCommerce Implementation - $2,500 → $1,200 (Portfolio Rate)

**Includes:**
- All 8+ GA4 eCommerce events (view_item → purchase)
- GTM web container setup (25+ tags/triggers/variables)
- Platform integration (Shopify Liquid, WooCommerce PHP, or Magento)
- Purchase deduplication logic
- 7-day validation + revenue reconciliation
- Basic Looker Studio dashboard (1-page executive summary)
- Documentation + 1-hour training

**Timeline:** 4-5 weeks (may extend if I encounter unexpected platform limitations - you only pay on milestone completion)

**Risk mitigation:**
- Milestone 1 (30%): After audit + implementation plan approval
- Milestone 2 (40%): After GTM deployment + initial testing
- Milestone 3 (30%): After 7-day validation shows ≥90% accuracy vs order data

**Refund policy:** If final validation shows <90% tracking accuracy, full refund of Milestone 3.

### 🚀 Server-Side Tracking Package - $3,500 → $1,750 (Portfolio Rate)

**Transparency:** I have not deployed server-side GTM in production yet. This represents:
- Extensive research (40+ hours studying documentation)
- Sandbox testing (GCP Cloud Run with demo data)
- Methodology adapted from Stape.io/Simo Ahava guides

**Why still offer it:**
- Technical capability is high (Cloud infrastructure comfortable from previous work)
- Willing to absorb learning curve time (won't bill for self-education)
- Industry guidance is comprehensive (well-documented implementations exist)

**Risk mitigation:** If server-side deployment fails technical validation, you only pay for standard implementation portion ($1,200).
