## Access Your Dashboard
**Live Dashboard**: [INSERT LOOKER STUDIO LINK]  
**Video Walkthrough**: [INSERT LOOM LINK]  
**Reconciliation Workbook**: [INSERT GOOGLE SHEETS LINK]

## First-Time Setup (One Time Only)
1. Open dashboard link → Google will ask you to log in
2. Use the email address I added as viewer: [CLIENT EMAIL]
3. Bookmark the dashboard URL for daily access
4. Watch 10-minute video walkthrough

## Daily Use
- **Date range**: Top-right dropdown (defaults to Last 30 Days)
- **Filters**: Use "Channel" and "Campaign" filters to drill down
- **Export**: Click ⋮ (three dots) → Download → PDF or CSV
- **Mobile**: Dashboard works on phone, best viewed on tablet/desktop

## Understanding the Numbers
**Why GA4 ≠ HubSpot ≠ LinkedIn?**  
See Sheet 2 in your reconciliation workbook. Expected variance is 0-10% due to:
- Different attribution windows (GA4 30-day, LinkedIn 7-day)
- Bot traffic filtering (GA4 filters, others don't)
- Timing delays (APIs sync every 15 min to 24 hours)

**Which number should I report to my boss?**  
- Lead volume → Use HubSpot (most accurate, deduplicated)
- Campaign performance → Use GA4 (best attribution)
- Ad spend ROI → Use native platform (LinkedIn Campaign Manager)

## Monthly Maintenance (5 Minutes)
- [ ] Check connector subscriptions paid (Porter Metrics $19/month)
- [ ] Verify data refresh working (last update date shown on dashboard)
- [ ] Review reconciliation workbook for out-of-range variances
- [ ] Update UTM parameters if launching new campaigns
