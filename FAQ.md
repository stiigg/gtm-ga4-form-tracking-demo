# Frequently Asked Questions

## "Why should I hire someone with 0 client projects?"

**Honest answer:** You probably shouldn't if you need:
- Proven track record
- References from past clients
- Fast turnaround (I'll be slower on first project)
- Guaranteed outcomes

**You should consider me if:**
- You want systematic QA approach (clinical-trial rigor)
- You value detailed documentation
- 60% discount makes risk acceptable ($1,200 vs $2,500)
- You're willing to be case study client
- You have 4-5 week timeline (not urgent)

## "What if you can't deliver?"

**Risk mitigation:**
1. Milestone-based payments (you control cash flow)
2. Refund guarantee if validation shows <90% accuracy
3. Working demo repository you can audit before hiring
4. Extended support period (I won't disappear)

**Worst case scenario:**
- Implementation doesn't meet accuracy threshold
- You get partial refund
- You wasted 4-5 weeks
- But you have detailed documentation of what was attempted

## "Why transition from clinical programming?"

**Honest reasons:**
1. Clinical trials work is repetitive after 5+ years
2. GA4/GTM uses similar technical skills (data pipelines, validation, QA)
3. Digital marketing is higher-growth field
4. Freelance flexibility appeals more than corporate pharma

**Not because:**
- I couldn't succeed in clinical programming (was promoted twice)
- Pharma skills aren't valuable (they're my competitive advantage)

## "What happens after first 3 portfolio clients?"

**Planned trajectory:**
1. **Clients 1-3:** Portfolio-building rate ($1,200), extensive documentation
2. **Clients 4-6:** Intermediate rate ($1,800), refining processes
3. **Clients 7+:** Standard rate ($2,500), established track record

**If first 3 projects fail:**
- I'll re-evaluate whether this career transition makes sense
- Refund clients and return to clinical programming
- Publish lessons learned transparently

## "Can I see your work before hiring?"

**Yes:**
- Demo repository: https://github.com/stiigg/gtm-ga4-form-tracking-demo
- Working forms with dataLayer visualization
- GTM container export (you can import and inspect)
- 80+ pages of documentation
- Systematic QA checklists

**Schedule call to:**
- Walk through technical implementation
- Review validation methodology
- Answer platform-specific questions
- Discuss your specific use case
