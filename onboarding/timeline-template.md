# Delivery Timeline Template

Standard 3-5 business day delivery schedule. Adjust if connectors or custom metrics extend scope.

| Day | Deliverable | Owner |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| Day 0 | Credentials received + access confirmed | Client/You |
| Day 1 | Connector setup (GA4, HubSpot, LinkedIn, Instantly) | You |
| Day 2 | Dashboard build (Looker Studio) + initial QA | You |
| Day 3 | Reconciliation + variance notes added | You |
| Day 4 | Client preview + feedback collected | Client |
| Day 5 | Final revisions + documentation + video walkthrough | You |

**Notes**
- If connectors fail, pause clock and notify client with required fixes.
- Use this timeline in proposals and kickoff emails.
