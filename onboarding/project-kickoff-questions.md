# Client Kickoff Questions (Copy-Paste into First Email)

## Platforms to Integrate
- [ ] GA4 - What's your Measurement ID? (format: G-XXXXXXXXX)
- [ ] HubSpot - What entities do you need? (Contacts, Deals, Companies, Custom Objects?)
- [ ] LinkedIn Ads - Porter ($19/month) or Coupler ($49/month)? Who pays subscription?
- [ ] Instantly - Do you have webhook access? What campaigns to track?

## Access Requirements
- [ ] GTM Container ID (format: GTM-XXXXXXX) - If none, I'll create
- [ ] GA4 Admin access (I need to configure custom dimensions)
- [ ] HubSpot API key or OAuth (for Looker Studio connector)
- [ ] LinkedIn Campaign Manager access (read-only is fine)
- [ ] Instantly account login (for Google Sheets integration)

## Dashboard Scope

- [ ] Who will use this dashboard? (executive, marketing ops, agency reporting?)
- [ ] How often do you need data refresh? (daily, hourly, real-time?)
- [ ] Any custom metrics? (e.g., "pipeline velocity", "lead quality score")

## Technical Setup

- [ ] Do you have BigQuery export enabled for GA4? (required for certain metrics)
- [ ] What's your company timezone? (for date alignment)
- [ ] Any existing dashboards I should see? (helps understand expectations)

## Delivery Preferences
- [ ] Dashboard delivery: Google Drive link, embedded iframe, or PDF exports?
- [ ] Documentation format: Video walkthrough, written guide, or both?
- [ ] Training: Do you need a 15-min Loom explaining how to use dashboard?
