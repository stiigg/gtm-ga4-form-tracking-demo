# Looker Studio Template IDs

Use these copyable dashboards for new client projects. Always duplicate before editing so the base templates remain unchanged.

## Templates
- **Multi-Platform Overview**: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/EXAMPLE-OVERVIEW
- **HubSpot Pipeline Performance**: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/EXAMPLE-HUBSPOT
- **LinkedIn Ads Deep Dive**: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/EXAMPLE-LINKEDIN
- **Instantly Outreach Health**: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/EXAMPLE-INSTANTLY

### How to Use
1. Open the template link and click **Use my own data**.
2. Swap each data source with the client's connectors (GA4, HubSpot, LinkedIn, Instantly).
3. Rename the copy with the client name and date (e.g., `ACME - Overview - 2025-01-10`).
4. Grant **Viewer** access to stakeholders and **Editor** access to your account.
