# Server-Side Tagging Cost-Benefit Calculator

Use this worksheet to model the ROI of implementing server-side GTM. Pair the assumptions here with the interactive CSV template in `infrastructure/sgtm-roi-calculator.csv`.

## Input Variables
- **Current monthly revenue**
- **Monthly ad spend** (Meta + Google Ads)
- **Current tracking accuracy %** (GA4 purchases vs order system)
- **Estimated improvement %** (25-35% typical with sGTM)
- **iOS/Safari traffic %** (higher → bigger uplift)
- **Hosting choice** (Stape managed vs GCP self-hosted)

## Formulas
- **Recovered revenue = Monthly revenue × (Target accuracy - Current accuracy)**
- **Ad efficiency lift = Ad spend × Expected ROAS improvement (15-25%)**
- **Monthly benefit = Recovered revenue + Ad efficiency lift**
- **Break-even (months) = Implementation cost ÷ Monthly benefit**
- **12-month ROI = (Monthly benefit × 12 - Implementation cost - Hosting cost × 12) ÷ Total costs**

## Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: $30K/month Shopify Store
- Current accuracy: 65%
- Target accuracy with sGTM: 92%
- Monthly benefit: ~$8,400 recovered attribution
- Hosting: Stape $40/month
- Break-even: <1 month (ROI ~210x)

### Scenario 2: $200K/month WooCommerce
- Current accuracy: 70%
- Target accuracy with sGTM: 95%
- Monthly benefit: ~$50K recovered attribution
- Hosting: GCP $180/month
- Break-even: <1 week (ROI ~278x)

### Scenario 3: $60K/month Magento Store (High iOS)
- Current accuracy: 60%
- Target accuracy: 90%
- iOS traffic: 45%
- Monthly benefit: ~$18K
- Hosting: GCP multi-region $220/month
- Break-even: ~0.2 months

## Decision Framework
- ✅ Implement now if iOS/Safari >30% or ad spend >$5K/month
- ✅ Implement now if GA4 purchases are 20-40% below order count
- ⚠️ Wait if revenue <$10K/month and ad spend <$2K/month
- ⚠️ Consider phased rollout if legal/compliance review pending

## How to Use
1. Open `infrastructure/sgtm-roi-calculator.csv` and import into Google Sheets or Excel.
2. Duplicate the template sheet generated by the import.
3. Enter your store metrics in the yellow cells.
4. Compare hosting options (Stape vs GCP) in the provided comparison section.
5. Share the summary with stakeholders as part of the project approval pack.
