## Frequently Asked Questions

### "What if I'm not satisfied with results?"

Milestone payment structure protects you:
- Milestone 1 (30%): After implementation plan approval
- Milestone 2 (40%): After GTM deployment passes testing
- Milestone 3 (30%): After 7-day validation shows ≥90% accuracy

**If final validation fails:** Full refund of Milestone 3.

---

### "Can I back out of testimonial requirement?"

Yes, but pricing adjusts:
- With testimonial: $1,200 (portfolio rate)
- Without testimonial: $2,000 (partial discount rate)
- Standard rate: $2,500

You decide after seeing results but before Milestone 3 payment.

---

### "How long is the portfolio offer valid?"

Until I collect 3 video testimonials. Current count: 0/3.

After 3rd testimonial, all new clients pay standard $2,500 rate.

---

### "What happens if implementation takes longer than expected?"

You're protected:
- Milestone payments mean you don't pay until deliverables complete
- Timeline extensions don't increase project cost
- I absorb any learning curve time (not billed to you)
